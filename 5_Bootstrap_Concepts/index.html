            Natural Landscapes</h1>
        <p>
        <p>
            The natural landscapes are the original landscapes existing without the influence of human culture.

            The natural landscapes are beautiful. We all need access to unspoiled nature for our welbeing, but due to
            human activity nature is increasingly threatened. We need to protect, preserve and maintain our invaluable
            natural world.
        </p>
        Here are the main types of natural landscapes:
        Desert, Plain, Taiga, Tundra, Wetland, Mountain, Mountain range, Cliff, Coast, Littoral zone, Glacier, Polar
        regions of Earth, Shrubland, Forest, Rainforest, Woodland, Jungle, Moors.

                        Plain are flat, sweeping landscapes existing as lowlands along the bottoms of valleys or on the
                        doorsteps of mountains, as coastal plains, and as plateaus or uplands.

                        In a valley, a plain is enclosed on two sides but in other cases a plain may be delineated by a
                        complete or partial ring of hills, by mountains or cliffs. Coastal plains would mostly rise from
                        sea level until they reach mountains or plateaus.

                        Plains are present on all continents and cover more than one-third of the world’s land area.
                        They may have formed by flowing lava, depositions by flowing water, ice, wind, or formed by
                        erosion by these agents from hills and mountains.

                        A desert is a barren landscape with little precipitation making plant and animal life difficult.
                        The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of
                        denudation.

                        The large variation in temperature between day and night put strains on the rocks which
                        consequently break in pieces. The wind picks up sand and dust producing sand storms. Sand grains
                        striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface. Rocks are smoothed down, and the
                        wind sorts sand into uniform deposits. The grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled
                        high in billowing sand dunes.

        <h2 class="taiga">Taiga</h2>
        <p>

            A taiga is a boreal forest or snow forest with pines, spruces or larches.

            The taiga is that type of natural landscape that covers the largest area on earth. In North America it
            covers
            most of inland Canada and Alaska as well as parts of the extreme northern continental United States where it
            is
            known as the Northwoods or “North woods”.

            In Europe it covers most of Sweden, Finland, much of Norway, some of the Scottish Highlands, some
            lowland/coastal areas of Iceland. Much of Russia from Karelia in the west to the Pacific Ocean, and areas of
            northern Kazakhstan, northern Mongolia, and northern Japan is covered by taiga.
        </p>
        <h2 class="tundra">
            Tundra


        </h2>
        <p>
            Tundra is a natural landscape where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing
            seasons.
            The term tundra is Russian in origin and means “uplands” or a “treeless mountain tract”. There are three
            types
            of tundra: Arctic tundra, alpine tundra, and Antarctic tundra.

            In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered
            trees
            grow in some tundra regions. The boundary region between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line
            or
            timberline.

        <h3 class="wetland">
            Wetland

        </h3>
        <p>
            A wetland is a land area that is saturated with water, either permanently or seasonally, and having a
            characteristic vegetation of aquatic plants, adapted to the hydric soil.

            Wetlands play important roles in the environment, principally in water purification, flood control and
            shoreline
            stability.

            Wetlands are the most biologically diverse of all natural landscapes being home to a wide range of plant and
            animal life.

            Wetlands occur naturally on every continent except Antarctica, the largest includes the Amazon River basin,
            the
            West Siberian Plain, and the Pantanal in South America.
